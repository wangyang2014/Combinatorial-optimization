RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS AND FILES

1. COMPILATION AND EXECUTION:
The sources files are in the src folder (the main function is in src/main.cpp).
Compile them by typing:   
       "make"
Launch some examples by typing: 
	"./localRun.sh" - i.e. all input files in subfolders of folder "instances" (provided in the archive) are considered

2. FILE INFORMATION
src/algo.cpp,h                - the effective code for the local search algorithms
src/basicRoutines.cpp,h       - code for "casual" basic routines (e.g. generate a random number between A and B giving a random generator from 0 to N)
src/bestSolAndTexOutput.cpp,h - keeping track of the best solution found so far, writting procedure (including LaTeX formats)
src/init.cpp,h                - reading input, memory allocation 
src/fastSet.cpp,h             - a new faster implementation of STD set
src/choices.h                 - defines directives for various choices (e.g., the starting point, enabling/disabling the above fast set class) 
src/globals.h                 - global variables
src/stdHeaders.h              - the standard headers (iostream, etc)
src/main.cpp                  - the main file calling routines from all others

"output" folder               - all the source code of all experiments and their results, sorted by date
